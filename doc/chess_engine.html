<H1>CHESS MOVE TABLE</H1>
<P>
The diagram below shows the CHESS_MOVE_TABLE. This data structure allows
us to produce all vaid moves. We index a large 2-D array with a piece
types, and a chess square. This gives us a list of "paths" in which
the chess piece may move. In this example we are looking at the
data structure for the <B>White Bishop</B> located on square <B>C1</B>

<P>
One of the key tasks of computerized chess is producing all the valid
moves at each ply in the search tree. The diagram above shows
the data structure for CHESS_MOVE_TABLE.
<P>
Pretend we have a <B>White Bishop</B> on square C1.
<OL>
<LI> Index the MOVE_TABLE with (White Bishop, C1)

<LI> Obtain the CHESS_MOVE_SQUARE from this index position in the 2-d ARRAY.

<LI> Iterate over all the CHESS_PATH's in the CHESS_PATH_LIST.

<LI> For a bishop on square C1 there are 2 paths. One going north-west and one
going north east.

<LI> We examine the list of squares along this path. This is all the valid moves
the bishop can make on square C1.

<LI> If we encounter a white piece, we are blocked and cannot move any further.

<LI> If we encounter a black piece, we have a CAPTURE move!!!! Which is
a very important move that we might want to look at.

</OL>


<H1>CHESS ATTACK TABLE</H1>
<P>
Another very important operation is knowing if the King is under attack (or in check).
This task is accomplished by using the CHESS_ATTACK_TABLE. In this example,
assume the <B>White King</B> is located on square <B>C1</B>.


<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="attack_table.jpg"></CENTER>
<P>

<P>
There are 6 CHESS_PATHS's that lead <B>to</B> this square. The Knight jumps
are shown in yellow. The straight paths are shown in blue. And the diagonal
paths are shown in dark red.
<P>
In order to figure out if the White King, located on square C1 is
in danger, we do the following:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Index the ATTACK table with the index <B>(Chess_color_white, C1)</B>.

<LI> Iterate over all the CHESS_PATH's in the CHESS_PATH_LIST

<LI> Follow all the squares in the CHESS_PATH. If we find a piece
of OUR color, we are safe.

<LI> If we find an a enemy piece along a path, we are possibly in danger, and
must check to see what type of piece is on that square.
