and simulates an internet chat room.

<H1>History:</H1>
Being out of work and looking for some project to keep my Eiffel skills fresh, I decided
in May of 2003 to submit a project to the <B>Eiffel Struggle 2003</B> competition.
<P>
<I>But what project?</I>
<P>
At the time I was playing chess with my ex-gf over the internet. And I was starting
to enjoy chess, and I started playing against people on the internet. I kept losing,
so I used my Igor Chess game to help give me hints and play against people on the internet.
<P>
Eventually it struck me that I could write a chess engine, and that it would be
a perfect project for the Eiffel Struggle 2003 competition, because:

<P>
<UL>
<LI> Will give me more eiffel experience.
<LI> Is a unique project in the eiffel open source world
<LI> May lead to consulting work
<LI> Can be used to learn the new ISE Eiffel Development environment
<LI> Will allow me to fill out my resume/portfolio
</UL>
<P>
At first my goal was a simple chess engine, with no GUI. I originally planned to
interface with WinBoard/XBoard programs. But I eventually decided to make a complete
game in Eiffel.
<P>
On April 13th, 2003 the idea for Hotbabe came to me. I was finished with the chess
engine by this time, and was trying to think of really unique and intuitive
user interfaces. Thats when I decided that a simulated internet chat room would
make a great interface.

<P>
<OL>
<LI> Most users already understand this type of game
<LI> Instructions can be displayed inside of the chat window
<LI> Playing computer chess is more fun when the computer has some
	"character".
