<P>
There are four clusters that comprise Hotbabe Chess. The root class
for this project is <B>CHESS_APPLICATION_MANAGER</B>. This is where all the
windows events are handled and where all the top level logic for this game happens.
<P>
<H1>Root Cluster</H1>
The root cluster is mainly concerned with managing the user interface
and all the logic associated with handling the user interactions.
<UL>
<LI> The root cluster has utility classes for saving/load chess games.
(CHESS_GAME_FILE)

<LI> The root cluster has 2 modal dialogs: New game dialog (NEW_GAME_DIALOG)
and Change Nickname Dialog (NICKNAME_DIALOG).

<LI> The root cluster has a utility class for converting hotbabe text messages
into a format that can be displayed in the chat output window (CHAT_TEXT_UTILITIES)

<LI> CHESS_APPLICATION_MANAGER is where the top-level game interaction is managed.

<LI> CHESS_MAIN_WINDOW is the actual WEL window that contains all the graphical
control.
</UL>
<P>


<H1>Chess Engine Cluster</H1>
The <B>Chess Engine</B> is a collection of classes for playing computer chess. The
primary class is CHESS_SEARCH, this answers the question "What move should I make?"
<P>
The class CHESS_GAME is a utility class that hold a current chess game, and all
the previous moves are stored in a CHESS_GAME_HISTORY.
<P>
A very important part of computer chess is producing valid chess moves (CHESS_MOVE)
quickly. This is accomplished by CHESS_BOARD_TABLES.
<P>
A chess position (class CHESS_POSITION), is a efficient representation of
a chess board and all the pieces, and any additional state information (CHESS_STATE).
<P>

<H1>Chess GUI Cluster</H1>
Several custom controls have been created for this application. All these
controls inherit from CHESS_GUI_CONTROL.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <B>CHESS_GUI_CONTROL</B>: Parent class for all controls

<LI> <B>CHESS_GUI_BOARD</B>: This is the chess board.

<LI> <B>CHESS_GUI_CHAT_MENU</B>: This is the chess command menu.

<LI> <B>CHESS_GUI_CHAT_OUTPUT</B>: This is the chat output window.

<LI> <B>CHESS_GUI_HISTORY</B>: This is the list of chess moves.

<LI> <B>CHESS_GUI_HISTORY_SCROLL</B>: This is a scroll bar for scrolling thru the
history moves.

<LI> <B>CHESS_GUI_IMAGE_BUTTON</B>: This is an image button.

<LI> <B>CHESS_GUI_STATIC</B>: This is a fancy static text control.

<LI> <B>CHESS_GUI_VIDEO</B>: This is webcam control for playing video clips.

<LI> <B>CHESS_GUI_VIDEO_DEVICE</B>: This is a WEX_DIGITAL_VIDEO_DEVICE.

<LI> <B>CHESS_GUI_WINDOW</B>: This is the main window parent class.
</UL>


<H1>Hotbabe Cluster</H1>
<P>
This cluster controls the hotbabe behavior. It manages a database of all the
hotbabe text messages and video clips (HOTBABE_DB). Hotbabe is event driven, and
every event HOTBABE responds to is a HOTBABE_EVENT. Our root cluster interfaces
with the HOTBABE class only.
