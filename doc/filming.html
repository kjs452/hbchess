<H1>Introduction:</H1>
The Hotbabe actress was filmed on a studio in hollywood, yeah right! It was
filmed on location in the programmers apartment.

<P>
This is what hotbabe was seeing while being filmed for this project.
Notice the clear plastic overlay on the TV monitor. Using a No. 4 black magic
marker we traced hotbabe in her "home" position. Before and after each video clip
she would make sure that she returns to this position. This allows all the clips to
be inter-twingled in a seamless fashion.
<P>
Various props are shown in front of hotbabe. To preserve continuity, all props
must not be visible in the camera. Hotbabe will fetch props out of the
view of the camera and then return the props outside of the camera field of view.
<P>
No actual marijuana was used in the making of hotbabe (unfortunately).
<P>
The keyboard was held in place with duct tape so that it didn't get moved
during shooting.
<P>
The chair had tape marks under each leg to make sure it never
got moved.
<P>

<P>
This is what the camera man/director/producer was seeing during the filming
of hotbabe.
<P>
The director would signal hotbabe to begin a clip. A yellow card was waved in
front of the camera so that during editing the clips could be easily located.
<P>
This film was created using a Sony DV cam corder (consumer level product).
<P>
The filming took place during the day and the window behind hotbabe was
masked out, but unfortunately it wasn't masked well enough because clips
done early vary from clips done at the end of the day.
<P>
It took about 5 hours for this filming session.
<P>
The unedited video was 1 hour long, which was edited down to 37 minutes.
<P>
The tripod had tape marks on the floor to make sure the tripod was not
moved during the 5 hours of shooting.
<P>
Four Home Depot 100 watt lights were used. One light was located above
and behind the actress for a backlight. Another backlight was used
to illuminate the bookshelf (and back wall).
<P>
The light fixture above the table was covered with white cloth to
soften the shadows.

A hard days work is over!
<P>
All the clips were edited on a PC computer using
ULead's Media Studio Pro software. The final video was compress using IR32 codec
at 5 frames/second and 160x120 resolution. The final video file is about 75 MB.
<P>
Some special effects were used. The spider was attached to fishing wire and
lowered and raised near the window. Also a small plastic rat was
animated using stop-frame animation (not really visable in the final version).

<P>

<P>
This is a high resolution, uncropped version of what my DV camera captured
during filming. The final version was cropped, so the keyboard is barely
visible. This was needed to increase the detail on hotbabe's face.
