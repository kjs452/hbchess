; FILE FORMAT NOTES:
;	* A comment is any line beginning with ';' (after leading whitespace
;	had been removed)
;
;	* Blank lines are ignored
;
;	* A record definition consists of the record letter 'G', 'T', etc..
;	followed by a single space character.
;
;	* To create a text record with a blank line, use the '~' character.
;
;	* Group names are case-insensitive
;
; STRING FORMATTING:
;	* BOLD: Bold text can be encoded by surrounding a phrase or word
;	  with asterisks. Eg.
;		T What's up? I think you are *cool*
;
;	* EMBEDDED LINKS: Embedded links are encoded by surrounding
;	  a fake URL with angled brackets
;
;		T Click <here|HELP> for help.
;
;	  The '|' seperates the link text from the underlying identifier that
;	  allows us to distinquish different links.
;
;	* VARIABLES: $ variables are things like $foo, $xxyyzz8860, etc..

T Your depth of comprehension may tend to make you lax in worldly ways.
T Your reasoning is excellent -- it's only your basic assumptions that are wrong.
T Your reasoning powers are good, and you are a fairly good planner.

T See my profile at <http://www.stauffercom.com/hotbabe>

T Don't PM me!!!! but e-mail is okay, <hotbabe@stauffercom.com|MAIL_TO>
T if you're wondering... my shirt reads *TRAILER TRASH*
T i need to confess, $player, i have never played chess before today.
T when asked to do this, my first thought was -- *porno*!!!
T i was created using Eiffel, the worlds greatest programming language
T i was written using Eiffel, the only language with class
T this game is bug free because Eiffel uses *design by contract*
+ (whatever the [S_HELL] that means!?!?)
T on the weekends, i teach chess to C++ programmers
T i have never worked on a project with kevin bacon
